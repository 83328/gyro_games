# Funding Overview – Grants vs. Loans (Germany / Berlin / EU)

This document summarizes **funding options relevant to our project** and clearly distinguishes between  
**non-repayable grants** and **(conditionally) repayable funding instruments**.

Our explicit goal:
> **No loans, no credits, no repayment obligations** – only **true grants (non-repayable subsidies)**.

Date of knowledge state: **2026-01-05**

---

## 1. What we are explicitly looking for

We are targeting **public funding programs that provide grants**, meaning:

- ✅ Non-repayable (no payback)
- ✅ No interest
- ✅ No equity loss
- ❌ No bank loans
- ❌ No repayable credits
- ❌ No revenue-dependent repayment models

Typical structure of grants:
- 40–80% of eligible project costs funded
- Remaining part covered by own contribution (cash or work time)
- Purpose-bound (development, prototype, innovation, market entry)

Our model (free for private users, later B2B monetization) is **compatible with grant logic** and often seen as a **positive factor**.

## 2. Berlin – Media & Games Funding (Important clarification)

### 🎮 Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg – Games / New Media

**Key clarification:**  
👉 This program is **NOT a pure grant**.

According to the official funding guidelines:

> Funding is generally provided as a **non-interest-bearing, conditionally repayable loan**.

**What this means in practice:**
- Formally structured as a **loan**
- No interest
- Repayment depends on contractual conditions (e.g. project success, exploitation, revenue)
- In many real cases it *feels* like a grant, but **repayment can be required**
- Legally **not guaranteed to be non-repayable**

**Conclusion:**
- ❌ Not a “true grant”
- ⚠️ Can still be useful strategically
- ❗ Must not be treated as risk-free funding

## 3. Germany – Federal Funding (High relevance)

### 🎮 Games Funding of the German Federal Government (BMWK)

This is one of the **most important programs for us**.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Non-repayable grant**
- ✅ No interest
- ✅ No repayment obligation
- Supports:
  - Prototypes
  - Full game production
  - Innovative gameplay & technology
- Typical funding rate:
  - Up to **50% of eligible costs**
- Minimum project size:
  - Approx. **€300,000**
- Application handled by:
  - **DLR Projektträger**

**Important notes:**
- Mandatory project consultation before application
- Costs are only eligible **after official project start**
- Open call (no fixed deadline, budget-based)

**Conclusion:**
- ✅ **True grant**
- ✅ Strong strategic fit
- ✅ Primary target funding program

## 6. Comparison Table

| Program | Funding Type | Repayable? | Risk |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg (Games) | Conditionally repayable loan | ⚠️ Possibly | Medium |
| Federal Games Funding (BMWK) | Grant | ❌ No | Low |
| ZIM (Germany) | Grant | ❌ No | Low |
| Creative Europe (EU) | Grant | ❌ No | Low |
| Horizon Europe | Grant | ❌ No | Low |

---

## 7. Recommended Funding Strategy

### Phase 1 – Low risk, early stage
- Federal Games Funding **OR**
- ZIM (technology focus)

### Phase 2 – Scaling
- Federal Games Funding (larger scope)
- Creative Europe (EU visibility)

### Phase 3 – Advanced innovation
- Horizon Europe (optional)

Medienboard funding can be **added carefully**, but **should not be relied on as a pure grant**.

---

## 8. Key takeaway

> **Not all “funding” is a grant.**
>
> Medienboard funding is **formally a loan**, even if conditions are favorable.  
> Federal and EU programs offer **true, non-repayable grants** and align best with our risk profile.

## 9. Next steps (optional)

- Prepare a **grant-optimized pitch narrative**
- Map our project phases to specific funding calls
- Create a cost plan aligned with grant eligibility rules
