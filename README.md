# Gyro Games — local multiplayer phone-as-controller demos
![Pong demo](media/images/pong.png)

Lightweight local demo that uses phones as motion controllers and a small Python aiohttp server to broadcast motion events to browser game pages. The idea behind this project is to see how old phones can be repurposed as motion controllers for simple local multiplayer games, without requiring any app installation.

## Features

- Phone streamer page (`/gyro.html`) — streams DeviceMotion / DeviceOrientation and acceleration to the server via WebSocket.

All the games:

- Maze Runner
	A multi-player grid maze race. Players tilt their phones to slide through corridors. Includes calibration and orientation-first controls for intuitive steering.

- Moon Lander
	Two players try to land gently on assigned landing pads. Tilt up for thrust and tilt side-to-side to rotate. Fuel and gentle auto-level assist help make it forgiving.

- Pong
	Classic paddle-vs-paddle demo — each phone controls a paddle angle or position depending on the mode. Good for quick one-on-one testing.

- Blob-eat
	Four-player arena where blobs grow by eating smaller blobs. Includes AI neutrals, display-area smoothing for nicer growth animations, and simple collision/eat rules.

- Turtle-style racer
	Small race demos where players 'pedal' by moving the phone. Multiple lane support and finish-line detection make these quick party games.

- Sumo Arena
	Small arena where players control their sumo wrestlers to push each other out of the ring. Fun for quick matches and testing balance.

- Blackhole Blaster
	Players control spaceships to avoid and shoot blackholes that appear randomly. The goal is to survive as long as possible while dodging the other ships.

## Quick start (Linux / macOS)

1. Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install minimal dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install aiohttp python-dotenv
```

3. (Optional) Create a .env file with a token to require clients to present the same token when connecting:

```
GYRO_TOKEN=some-secret-token
# Optionally set a public ws_url if you're using a tunnel service
# WS_URL=wss://xxxx.ngrok.io/ws
```

4. Run the server:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

5. Open the pages in your browser (or expose the server with ngrok and open the forwarded URL on phones):

- Host machine: http://localhost:8080/ (the server serves `static/index.html`)
- Phone (streamer): http://<your-host>:8080/gyro.html
- Game selector page: http://<your-host>:8080/index.html

How it works (short)
- A phone opens `/gyro.html`, selects a role (blue/red/yellow/green), and starts streaming. The page requests device motion/orientation permissions on iOS and sends compact JSON payloads over WebSocket.
- The server forwards messages to all connected clients. Game pages listen on the same WebSocket and apply incoming telemetry to the matching player role.

Controls & calibration
- Prefer orientation angles (deviceorientation) when available; otherwise the streamer falls back to rotationRate integration.
- `maze.html` contains a small "Calibrate" button (saves neutral orientation to localStorage). Calibration persists across reloads.
- `lander.html` and other game pages include small HUDs and invert toggles to adjust device sign conventions per phone.

## Development notes
- The server is a minimal aiohttp app in `server.py`. It serves files from `static/` and implements `/api/token` and `/ws` endpoints.
- If you get a ModuleNotFoundError for `dotenv`, install `python-dotenv` or remove the `.env` usage in `server.py`.

## Troubleshooting
- WebSocket fails to connect: check server console for handshake logs. If you set `GYRO_TOKEN` then the client must pass the same token (see `/api/token` response). If you see malformed ws URLs like `wss://https//...` check any `WS_URL` you configured.
- iOS motion permission: Safari requires a user gesture to request motion/orientation permission. Open `/gyro.html` and tap Start; if the page doesn't prompt, check the Safari settings and ensure HTTPS/localhost and a user gesture.
- Virtualenv pip wrapper broken: recreate the venv using `python3 -m venv .venv` and reinstall packages with `python -m pip install ...`.
