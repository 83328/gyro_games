**Eligible costs**
- Software development
- Technical services
- Hardware
- External services
- Early personnel costs
- Infrastructure related to founding

**Why it fits us**
- No cultural test

## 3. Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg – Games Funding

**Status:** Active, with **periodic submission deadlines**  
**Region:** Berlin-Brandenburg

**What it is**
- Regional funding program for **games and interactive digital projects**.

**Funding**
- Grants typically in the range of **~€30k–€100k+**, depending on project scope
- Supports prototype and production phases

**Important notes**
- Cultural evaluation exists, but is **less rigid** than the federal “Kulturtest”
- Jury-based decisions
- Higher risk than pure tech funding, but more open to experimental formats

**Why it may fit**
- Regional proximity
- Openness to experimental, event-based, or interaction-driven games
- Better odds than national games funding for non-narrative projects

## 4. Transfer BONUS Gamification / XR (Berlin)

**Status:** Active (rolling intake, project-based approval)  
**Region:** Berlin only

**What it is**
- A **Berlin state-funded program** supporting **technology transfer projects**
  between creative-tech companies (games, interactive media, XR)
  and **Berlin-based SMEs or institutions**.

**Funding**
- Covers **up to 70% of project costs**
- Typical project volume: **€10,000–€50,000**
- Duration: usually **6–12 months**

**Requirements**
- A **cooperation partner in Berlin** (e.g. SME, organization, institution)
- Clear **technology transfer** aspect (not pure entertainment)
- Focus on applied innovation (interactive systems, real-time input, simulation, XR)

**Why it fits us**
- No cultural test
- Strong emphasis on **applied technical innovation**
- Well suited if:
  - Core interaction or input technology is adapted to non-game contexts
  - The project involves events, exhibitions, training, or simulation scenarios

**Limitations**
- Not suitable for standalone game development
- Requires a concrete external partner and use case

## 5. Research Allowance (German R&D Tax Credit – Forschungszulage)

**Status:** Always open (no deadlines)  
**Region:** Germany (including Berlin)

**What it is**
- A **tax-based R&D incentive**, not a grant.
- Supports **experimental development and applied research**, including software.

**Funding**
- ~**25% of eligible R&D costs**
- ~**35% for SMEs**
- Applies to:
  - Salaries
  - Certain internal development efforts
  - Documented experimental work

**Why it fits us extremely well**
- No cultural test
- No narrative or artistic requirements
- Ideal for:
  - Experimental system architecture
  - Scalability and performance challenges
  - Real-time interaction and synchronization problems
- Failure is allowed (technical uncertainty is expected)

**Key requirement**
- Proper **technical documentation** of uncertainty, experiments, and iterations

## 6. Other Berlin / Federal Options (Conditional)

### EXIST Startup Grant
- Only relevant if we have a **formal university affiliation**
- Strong technology and innovation focus
- Managed via Berlin universities

---

## Strategic Conclusion

Given our project profile (retro-inspired gameplay combined with **technically ambitious, real-time interaction systems**):

- ❌ Federal Games Funding (culture test): **high risk**
- ✅ Berlin Startup Scholarship: **very good fit**
- ✅ GründungsBONUS Plus: **very good fit**
- ✅ Transfer BONUS Gamification / XR: **strong option if partner-based**
- ✅ Research Allowance (R&D tax credit): **core long-term funding pillar**
- ⚠️ Medienboard Games Funding: **possible, but secondary**

**Recommended strategy**
1. Use **Berlin Startup Scholarship** for early full-time work.
2. Apply for **GründungsBONUS Plus** to cover concrete development costs.
3. Leverage **Transfer BONUS Gamification / XR** for partner-driven applied projects.
4. Structure the company (UG) to fully utilize the **R&D tax credit**.
5. Treat games funding as optional, not core.
