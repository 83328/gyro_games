## 🔍 1. What we are explicitly looking for

We are targeting **public funding programs** with the following properties:

### ✅ Must have
- 🟢 **Non-repayable**
- 🟢 No interest
- 🟢 No equity loss
- 🟢 Public funding (Berlin / Federal / EU)

### ❌ Must NOT have
- 🔴 No bank loans
- 🔴 No conditionally repayable credits
- 🔴 No revenue-based repayment models
- 🔴 No “looks like a grant but is legally a loan”

💡 Typical grant structure:
- 40–80% of eligible project costs funded
- Remaining share covered by own contribution (cash or work time)
- Purpose-bound (R&D, prototype, innovation, market entry)

Our model (free/private usage, later B2B monetization) is **compatible with grant logic** and often seen as a **positive factor**.
